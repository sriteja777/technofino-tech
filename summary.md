 This is a detailed summary of a lengthy forum discussion on Technofino, focusing on strategies for maximizing credit card bill payment rewards using various debit cards in June 2025.

**Key Points:**

*   **IDFC Firstap RuPay Debit Card:** Still a popular option. Users emphasize getting the add-on RuPay variant to avoid charges and ensure eligibility for rewards on PhonePe and Freecharge. Welcome bonuses are again available when applying for the RuPay variant. A key point is to ensure the merchant name is "FREECHUTIL" or one of the explicit PhonePe Recharge variations for eligibility. Goodscore app mentioned as an alternative to earn rewards by paying cc bill but it only supports 2Lakh plus transactions, however, a 99+GST monthly membership is required and a PAN number has to be shared. User tests for various methods with it for idfc rupay, which all give it a mixed review. Some users prefer sticking to SBI VDC due to data privacy concerns. Zavo becomes a backup option since Goodscore stopped its CC bill support. There is a monthly rewards cap based on the account type.
*   **SBI Virtual Debit Card (VDC):** Double reward points compared to physical SBI RuPay cards. There is a base reward value of 0.25% + a virtual bonus value of 0.25%, totaling 0.50% value. Milestone rewards are available for spending over ₹50k or ₹1 lakh depending on the card (Physical or Virtual), though these benefits have had inconsistencies. Many users report that newly created accounts/cards can take 2-3 months to be properly linked to the SBI Rewardz system. There is also a monthly limit on earnable rewards - 10k points total. Many are using SBI Unipay, PhonePe, Freecharge and BillDesk for payments. But users are advised to have a lot of patience for it and its reward system. Has a limit of 50k to 1 Lacks Rupee but has a tendency to block cards (requiring manual unblocking. Zavo app mentioned also supports SBI VDC but no testing is done.
*   **RBL Enterprise Debit Card:** Freecharge is mentioned as a place to use this card for CC bill payments to get cashback, but there are charges involved. Ebixcash wallet is mentioned for milestone benefits. Ebixcash Wallet UPI (Android only) is the latest discovery.
*   **HDFC Millennia Debit Card:** Loading money into Airtel Payments Bank account is mentioned as a way to earn 1% cashback. Its HDFC autpay features where one can get 2.5 cash back on certain transactions are also highlighted.
*    **Kotak 811 Super DC:** To achieve cashback in these one needs to have saveage application ( 0.59% charges but 5% cashback).
*   **IndusInd Debit Cards:** Mentioned that IndusInd Visa Signature cards still work on Paytm, but with a convenience fee. Rewards for IndusInd Mastercard on PayZapp seem inconsistent.
*   **Zavo App:** A new app, Zavo, is highlighted as a promising option for IDFC Firstap RuPay card users. The RuPay variant has no extra charges on the Zavo app. Note that 1 Lakh limit as they make debit card payments on this app. Limited testing on has being done to see how it performs. Some also mentioned its mandatory to use a valid PAN Card. **UPDATE:** GoodScores is also an option for users in addition to PhonePe.
*   **Freecharge App:** A common platform for debit card-based CC bill payments. RuPay variant has no extra charges. Need "FREECHUTIL" Merchant name on bill statement for cashbacks.

**Main Questions and Concerns:**

*   The primary concern revolves around the reliability and sustainability of various debit card-based CC bill payment methods due to frequent changes in merchant categories, fees, and reward structures.
*   Users are actively seeking alternative apps and platforms that offer consistent rewards and minimal charges.
*   The safety and privacy of using newer, less-established apps (like Zavo) that require PAN details is also a significant concern.
*   Users were confused and seeking clarification on milestone and welcome bonus reward on various bank cards.

**Conclusions and Consensus (as of the latest messages):**

*   **Uncertainty and Fluctuations:** The landscape is constantly shifting. Methods that work one day might be patched or devalued the next. Diligence in monitoring merchant names, fees, and reward conditions is essential.
*   **IDFC Firstap RuPay Remains Prominent:** While some individual reports suggest inconsistencies, the IDFC Firstap Sticker RuPay Platinum Debit Card continues to be a frequently mentioned option for those seeking rewards on CC bill payments. It has been confirmed to work without extra charges on Goodscore app and Freecharge.
*   **SBI VDC a Reliable, if Less Rewarding, Backup:** The SBI Virtual Debit Card is generally seen as a reliable option, though with a lower reward rate and some limitations (transaction limits, potential flagging of new accounts). But 120 TAT is pain
*   **Due Diligence is Crucial:** Users should exercise caution and thoroughly investigate any new app or platform before entrusting them with personal financial information. Monitoring transaction details and contacting customer support is advised.
*   **The Hunt Continues:** The search for stable, reliable, and rewarding methods for debit card-based CC bill payments remains ongoing.

**Outdated Information (as of 2025-06-08):**

*   Information regarding PhonePe as a reliable platform for IDFC RuPay is mostly outdated. While technically *possible*, it's inconsistent and often doesn't yield the desired rewards. Some stated that this method no longer work.
*   Some specifics about reward redemption processes and platform-specific quirks mentioned in older messages might no longer be accurate due to policy changes or app updates.
*   The availability and terms of specific promotions, like extra cashback on certain websites, are subject to change.
*   The information about EbixCash is outdated. It is no longer a viable option.
