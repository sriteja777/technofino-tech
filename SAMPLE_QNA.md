Your question: What is the latest working method for idfc debit cards?

Answer: The latest working method for IDFC debit cards as of 2025-06-07 for credit card bill payments involves using the Zavo app with an IDFC Firstap RuPay debit card. The merchant name you should see on the transaction is LEGALPAYTECH.

It's important to note a few things:

* This information might be outdated quickly, as these methods seem to change frequently due to banks updating their terms and conditions.
* It's crucial to verify the information before making any transactions, as some methods that worked previously may no longer be effective or could result in unexpected charges. Several users in the thread emphasize this.
* The thread mentions that Freecharge (with the "FREECHUTIL" merchant name) used to be another option, but it appears to be unreliable now.
* Zavo also seems to be having issues with some users, with transactions failing and long refund times.
* The extract also notes that while IDFC RuPay cards are preferred for Zavo due to no extra charges, other users highlight that the use of IDFC Visa debit cards on Zavo has also resulted in successful transactions


Your question: Any app other than Zavo that is working for idfc debit cards?                 

Answer: Based on the provided thread, the answer to the question "Any app other than Zavo that is working for idfc debit cards?" is: It appears that *Goodscore* is working, but the debit card option may only be available for credit card bill payments above 2 lakhs and also require the installation of certain UPI apps. Some users are also reporting issues with failed transactions or difficulty getting the Goodscore app to work. Therefore, Zavo is better because its working but again to note is it is just for RuPay not VISA and its all depend upon to individuals .
